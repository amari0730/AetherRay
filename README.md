### Running the Program

The program can be run in `QtCreator` by putting the absolute path of a `.ini` file in as an argument. Additionally, note that the working directory must be properly set to the parent of the `CMake`.

The terminal can also be used to run `run-intersect.sh` and `run-illuminate.sh` using

```sh
  sh run-intersect.sh
```

and

```sh
  sh run-illuminate.sh
```

Ensure that the relevant `.ini` files have the appropriate paths.

Finally, the termianl can be used to run `renderFrame.py` with

```sh
  python3 renderFrame.py
```

or something like that based on your `python` path. Note that the paths mentioned in the file must be changed to the absolute paths for your machine.
